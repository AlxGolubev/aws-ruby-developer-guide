Encrypting an |S3| Bucket Item with a Client-Side Master Key

    :description:
        Encrypt Amazon S3 bucket items with a client-side master key using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
`Cipher <http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/Cipher.html>`_
class to encrypt an item with a 256-bit AES key and the
:ruby-sdk-api:`put_object <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_object-instance_method>` method
to add the item :code-ruby:`my_item` to the bucket
:code-ruby:`my_bucket` in the :code:`us-west-2` region.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *encrypt_item_cseaes.rb*.

Added the required |S3| and OpenSSL gems.
Note how in V2 the |sdk-ruby| did not have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 13-14
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Set the region, bucket name, item name, and key value.
See the :doc:`kms-example-create-key` example for information on creating a |KMS| key.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 16-19
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create the cipher, random initialization vector, and key and display the value
of the initialization vector as you need that value to decrypt the item.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 22-33
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Open the file, get it's contents, and encrypt it.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 36-41
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create an |S3| client, call **put_object** to upload the item to the bucket,
and display a success message.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_add_csaes_encrypt_item.rb
   :lines: 44-53
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
