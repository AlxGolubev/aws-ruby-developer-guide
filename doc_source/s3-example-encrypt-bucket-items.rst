        Encrypt Amazon S3 bucket items using these AWS SDK for Ruby code examples.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The :doc:`s3-example-set-item-props` example added a number of properties, including server-side encryption,
to a bucket item. The following examples demonstrate how to encrypt and decrypt
bucket items using both server-side encryption as shown in that example, and
client-side encryption.
For more information about encryption in |S3|, see
`Protecting Data Using Encryption <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingEncryption.html>`_.
