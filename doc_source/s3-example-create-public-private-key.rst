########################################################################
Creating Public and Private RSA Keys to Encrypt Client-Side Bucket Items
########################################################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Create public and private keys upload client-side encrypted items to Amazon S3 buckets using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
`PKey <http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/PKey.html>`_
class to create a public/private RSA key pair that you can use to
encrypt items on the client before you upload them to an |S3| bucket.
You'll need these keys in the next two examples.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *create_rsa_keys.rb*.

Added the required OpenSSL gem.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/create_rsa_keys.rb
   :lines: 13
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Set the pass phrase to seed the key and create the key.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/create_rsa_keys.rb
   :lines: 15-16
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Save the public key as *public_key.pem* and the private
key as *private_secure_key.pem*.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/create_rsa_keys.rb
   :lines: 19-28
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
