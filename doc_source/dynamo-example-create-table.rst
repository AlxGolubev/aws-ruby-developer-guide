Creating a Simple |DDBlong| Table with a Single Primary Key

    :description:
        Create a table with one primary key using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples, DynamoDB

The following example creates the table :code-ruby:`Users` with three attributes: :code-ruby:`ID`,
:code-ruby:`FirstName`, and :code-ruby:`LastName` in the :code-ruby:`us-west-2` region.

The :code-ruby:`wait_until` call blocks you from using the table until |DDBlong| has created it.  By
default, the |DDB| client's :code-ruby:`wait_until` method checks every 20 seconds, up to a maximum
of 500 seconds, to see if the table was created.
