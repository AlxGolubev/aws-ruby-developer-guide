Requiring a Server-Side |S3| Managed Key to Upload |S3| Bucket Items

    :description:
        Require server-side encryption to upload Amazon S3 bucket using this AWS SDK for Ruby code example.
    :keywords: AWS SDK for Ruby code examples

The following example uses the
:ruby-sdk-api:`put_bucket_policy <Aws/S3/Client.html#put_bucket_policy-instance_method>` method
to require that items uploaded to an |S3| bucket have
AES-256 encryption.
Attempts to upload an item without AES-256 encryption enabled on the item
raise an :code:`Aws::S3::Errors::AccessDenied` exception.

Choose :code:`Copy` to save the code locally.

Create the file *add_sses3_policy.rb*.

Add the required |S3| gem.

.. note:: Version 2 of the |sdk-ruby| didn't have service-specific gems.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_add_bucket_sses3_encryption_policy.rb
   :lines: 13
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Set the bucket name.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_add_bucket_sses3_encryption_policy.rb
   :lines: 15
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

Create an |S3| policy that requires a server-side 256-bit AES cipher on items
uploaded to the bucket.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_add_bucket_sses3_encryption_policy.rb
   :lines: 18-47
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby

To require server-side KMS, change:

.. code-block:: ruby

   's3:x-amz-server-side-encryption': 'AES256'

to:

.. code-block:: ruby

   's3:x-amz-server-side-encryption': 'aws:kms'

Create the |S3| client, apply the policy to the bucket, and print a success message.

.. literalinclude:: ./example_code/s3/s3_add_bucket_sses3_encryption_policy.rb
   :lines: 50-58
   :dedent: 0
   :language: ruby
